# GlobalTerrorismAttack_EDA #InternshipProject@TheSparksFoundation#JUNE2023
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis of Global Terrorism Attack since 1970 to 2017. 
As a Security/Defense Analyst, the objective behind this project are as follows :

**OBJECTIVE:** To perform Exploratory Data Analysis, that includes the following :
Investigation of data points.

To find missing values.

Statistical mearsure and view of data.

To detect anomalies or outliers.

Discovering patterns.

Graphical representation of data.

To find out the hot zone of terrorism.

To find out security issues and insights out of EDA.
The Global Terrorism Dataset is a large amount of data that consists 135 columns and 181691 rows.

**Data:**
The data used for this project is the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is a comprehensive database of terrorist attacks from 1970 to the present. The GTD contains over 180,000 attacks, and includes information on the date, location, target, perpetrators, and casualties of each attack.

**Methodology:**
This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze the GTD data. EDA is a data analysis technique that is used to explore the data, identify patterns, and generate insights. The following EDA techniques are used in this project:

Data cleaning: The data is cleaned to remove errors and inconsistencies.(Reducded irrelevant columns to get inights clarity)
Summary statistics: Summary statistics are calculated to describe the data.
Data visualization: The data is visualized using graphs and charts.(Scatter plot and histogram).

**Insights:**
Number of attacks have increased from 1970 to 2017 by 94.0%
Country Iraq is found to be highly targetted and has the most attacks and hence is considered as the hot zone of terrorism.
The Middle East and North Africa regions are again the most taregeted ones.
Bombing/Explosion is the most frequent method of attack by terrorists.
Taliban and ISIL are ont the top of the list of most active terrorist organisations.

**Conclusion:**
This project has demonstrated the value of using EDA to analyze global terrorism data. The insights generated from the EDA can be used to improve security and prevent future terrorist attacks.
